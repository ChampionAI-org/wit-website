Field: Campaign Description

Wit AI is a professional productivity suite where an Executive Assistant manages a user's email, calendar, and SMS communications. We provide professionals with dedicated assistant numbers for 1:1 business communication. The assistant helps the executive manage context, draft replies, and coordinate scheduling based on real-time availability. All messaging is 1:1 and manually initiated by the professional to their existing business contacts.


Field: Message Flow / CTA

Our users (professionals) initiate 1:1 professional conversations with their contacts who have provided consent through existing business relationships or verbal/word-of-mouth agreement. Every professional is required to pass a mandatory in-app "SMS Consent & Compliance" gate where they must explicitly acknowledge our zero-tolerance policy and confirm they have obtained express consent before being granted access to SMS features. 

To ensure total compliance, an automated parenthetical disclosure is appended at least once to messages sent to a contact. This provides immediate brand identification and opt-out instructions. All messaging is 1:1 and manually directed by the professional. We provide a public compliance and SMS terms page outlining our standards and privacy controls at [https://witagent.ai/compliance](https://witagent.ai/compliance). All users are required to honor opt-out requests immediately. Any violation of these terms results in immediate revocation of the assigned SMS number.

In-App Compliance Gate (Mandatory for Executives)

To ensure total compliance, every professional executive is presented with a mandatory "SMS Consent & Compliance" screen before they can use their assigned SMS number. 

**Publicly Hosted Evidence of Compliance Gate:**
[https://witagent.ai/sms-compliance-gate](https://witagent.ai/sms-compliance-gate)

They must explicitly agree to the following:
1. They have obtained express consent from their contacts.
2. They understand that Wit AI maintains a zero-tolerance policy for abuse.
3. They acknowledge that their assigned number will be revoked immediately if they violate SMS terms.

This screen ensures that every message sent via Wit AI is initiated by an informed professional who has confirmed they have the legal right to message their contact.

Brand Consistency:

Check: Is "Wit AI" the only brand mentioned? (No Saul Holding or Champion AI).

Handling "Word of Mouth" Opt-In

In your setup, the opt-in is conversational. Carriers accept "Verbal Consent" or "Existing Business Relationship" for 1:1 professional tools. When filling out the Twilio forms:

Opt-In Type: Select "Conversational" or "Keyword" if possible.

Explanation: State that "Users (executives) obtain verbal or written consent during their professional engagements before initiating the first SMS via the Wit AI platform."

The "Safety Net": The parenthetical append (Sent via Wit AI...) in the first message acts as your legally required "Confirmation" that they are now in an SMS-enabled thread.
