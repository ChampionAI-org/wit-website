Field: Campaign Description

Wit AI is a professional productivity suite where an Executive Assistant manages a user's email, calendar, and SMS communications. We provide professionals with dedicated assistant numbers for 1:1 business communication. The assistant helps the executive manage context, draft replies, and coordinate scheduling based on real-time availability. All messaging is 1:1 and manually initiated by the professional to their existing business contacts.


Field: How do end-users consent to receive messages?

End-users (professional contacts) provide consent through existing business relationships or verbal/word-of-mouth agreement with the executive. To enforce this, every Wit AI user must pass a mandatory in-app "SMS Consent & Compliance" gate (the Call-to-Action) on their mobile device before sending any messages. In this flow, the user is presented with a mandatory acknowledgment screen where they must actively confirm they have obtained express consent from their contacts before the SMS feature is unlocked. Once consent is confirmed via this in-app CTA, messages are delivered 1:1. A hosted screenshot of this mandatory mobile enforcement and consent CTA can be viewed here: [https://witagent.ai/sms-compliance-gate](https://witagent.ai/sms-compliance-gate). Additionally, the very first message sent to any contact includes a mandatory parenthetical disclosure identifying the brand and providing immediate opt-out (STOP) and help (HELP) instructions.
